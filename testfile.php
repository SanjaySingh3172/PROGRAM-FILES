<div class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>DO VEGANS NEED PROTEIN POWDER?</div>
<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
<p>Incorporating protein into your diet is essential—it’s considered the building block for our muscles and organs, it helps to boost energy and it’s vital for our overall health and well-being.</p>
<p>Some believe vegans need to monitor their daily intake of protein a little more closely than non-vegans as often the protein sourced from plant-based foods is digested less efficiently than animal protein. Plant-based protein can also have a different blend of amino acids and these are essential for maintaining healthy bodily functions.</p>
<p>That being said, if you’re vegan and planning your diet well, you can absolutely get sufficient amounts of protein from plant-based food sources such as beans, legumes, grains, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Including a vegan protein powder into your diet can be a great additional protein source and a way to get the necessary nutrients your body needs.</p>

Using a protein powder is a quick and easy way to ensure you’re getting the necessary intake of daily protein, especially for those who have trouble meeting their protein requirements from plant-based food sources.</p>

<div class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>HOW DO I GET ENOUGH PROTEIN AS A VEGAN THROUGH DIET?</div>
<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
<p>By consuming a plant-based diet, you can provide your body with the protein, minerals and vitamins you need. Below are some vegan protein sources that are good options to ensure you’re getting enough protein as a vegan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Legumes – including chickpeas, lentils and beans.</li>
<li>Nuts (excluding coconut).</li>
<li>Seeds – including pumpkin, chia, sunflower and sesame seeds.</li>
<li>Grains – including wheat, oats, barley, quinoa and buckwheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plant-based proteins are considered lower in one or more of the essential amino acids that we need in our diets than animal protein, which contains all of the essential amino acids. If you’re a vegan, it’s important to eat a variety of foods from quality sources in your diet, to ensure you’re getting all the vitamins and nutrients you need throughout the day.</p>
<p>Happy Way’s Vegan Protein Powders are not only filled with quality ingredients such as chia seeds, psyllium husk and maca powder, but they also contain all of the essential amino acids needed in our diets.</p>
<p>Having a protein shake or smoothie is a great way to get all the nutrients you need that help to boost your immune system, assist with muscle recovery and improve digestion. Check out our <a href="#">Happy Way recipes</a> page for a selection of yummy high protein, vegan recipes.</p>
<p>If you have health concerns or questions about being vegan and getting enough protein in your diet, speak to your healthcare professional.</p>

<div class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>WHAT IS VEGAN PROTEIN POWDER?</div>
<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
<p>Vegan protein powder is made from a plant-based protein that is sourced from plant matter such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>pea</li>
<li>rice</li>
<li>hemp</li>
<li>soy</li>
</ul>
<p>Converted into a powdered form, vegan protein supplements contain varying amounts of protein depending on where it’s sourced, the flavour, brand etc.</p>
<p>At Happy Way, our vegan protein powders contain either a plant protein blend of rice and pea protein or hemp protein. The combination of the two plant-based proteins provides higher quantities of certain essential amino acids which are required from our diet to maintain healthy bodily functions. Hemp protein also contains all 9 essential amino acids, making it a complete protein. See a breakdown of each below.</p>
<h6>PEA PROTEIN</h6>
<ul>
<li>Pea protein is made from yellow split peas and is ideal for someone who wants to build muscle along with their fitness training.</li>
Is a great source of iron and is good for heart health.Assists with weight loss and weight management.
<li>Contains all 9 essential amino acids - histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine.</li>
<li>Works with many diets as it doesn’t contain high allergen ingredients such as peanuts, eggs, fish, shellfish, cows milk, wheat, soy.</li>
<li>Can create a feeling of fullness, just like dairy-based protein powders</li>
</ul>
<h6>RICE PROTEIN</h6>
<ul>
<li>Rice protein is allergen and gluten-free, considered easy to digest and contains a reasonable amount of protein.</li>
<li>Most rice supplements are derived from brown rice as it offers higher protein than white rice.</li>
<li>Assists with muscle growth, strength building and weight management.</li>
<li>Sustainable and environmentally friendly.</li>
<li>Contains 8 of the 9 essential amino acids, missing lysine which is found in pea and hemp protein.</li>
</ul>
<h6>HEMP PROTEIN</h6>
<ul>
<li>Hemp protein is one of the most popular vegan proteins as it contains all 9 essential amino acids and is also one of the easiest to digest.</li>
<li>Contains a high source of fibre that will assist with gut health and digestion and is believed to help reduce the risk of bowel cancer.</li>
<li>Is a rich source of minerals (magnesium, iron, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, copper) and antioxidants which are great for your health.</li>
<li>Contains essential fatty acids Omega-3 and Omega-6 which improve heart health, mental health and are good for metabolism.</li>

<div class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>IS VEGAN PROTEIN POWDER BETTER THAN WHEY PROTEIN POWDER?</div>
<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
<p>Both <a href="#">whey</a> and <a href="#">vegan</a> protein powders offer nutritional benefits and help to boost energy, maintain muscle mass, improve strength and assist with weight management. Vegan protein powder is best if you follow a plant-based diet or are gluten-free, being that whey protein is made from animal sources (milk). It’s for this reason that vegan protein can typically be lower in fat and calorie content than whey protein.</p>
<p>Using a vegan protein powder is great for individuals who are lactose intolerant or have issues with allergies as they can be easier to digest, promote overall gut health and help to boost metabolism.</p>
<p>Whey protein formulas have been considered better than plant-based protein in the past because they are considered complete proteins, meaning they contain the essential amino acids necessary for protein synthesis. However, at Happy Way, our vegan protein powders consist of a plant protein blend and contain all nine essential amino acids that are necessary for our diet, to help build and support muscle growth and repair.</p>

<div class="question"><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>DOES VEGAN PROTEIN POWDER HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT?</div>
<div class="answer" style="display: none;">
<p>Using a vegan protein powder can assist with weight loss and weight management as it can help to control the appetite, promoting a feeling of fullness, leaving you feeling satisfied for a longer period. Some people believe that this is even more apparent in vegan protein powders than in whey protein.</p>
<p>A protein powder that contains all 9 essential amino acids will also assist with controlling weight as they’re absorbed rapidly by the muscles in our bodies, rather than being broken down by the liver. This provides a great source of energy during exercise, enabling you to train for longer periods, resulting in the loss of weight and a decrease in fat.</p>
<p>Incorporating protein powder into your daily diet can help you to lose weight but it shouldn’t be looked at as a ‘magic powder’—it needs to be consumed along with a healthy diet and physical activity. Whilst a higher intake of protein can allow you to eat fewer calories and not leave you feeling hungry, having an excessive amount of protein and not burning calories through exercise can affect your weight-loss efforts.</p>

<div class="question"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>DOES VEGAN PROTEIN POWDER MAKE YOU GAIN WEIGHT?</div>
<div style="display: none;" class="answer">
<p>Vegan protein powders are protein supplements that need to be used in conjunction with a healthy diet and exercise program. Diets that are rich in protein are said to promote fat loss rather than weight gain and including protein powders into a well-balanced diet can help to control the appetite, increase calories burned during exercise and even assist with losing unwanted belly fat.</p>
<p>As with anything in our diet, it’s important to consume everything in balance and moderation, so we’re not taking in more calories than we need for energy. Any calories consumed in excess can be stored as body fat, leading to weight gain.</p>
<p>It’s important to take the recommended serving per day of protein powder and keep in mind the best times to enjoy your shake or smoothie to gain the maximum benefits. Read our blog, <a href="#"> 'The best protein powder types &amp; flavours’ </a>to learn more about how to incorporate protein powder into your daily diet.</p>

<div class="question"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>WHAT DO I LOOK FOR IN A VEGAN PROTEIN POWDER?</div>
<div style="display: none;" class="answer">
<p>As with any protein supplement, it’s important to look at the ingredients as well as consider what you’re trying to achieve in regards to your health and fitness goal. This will help you determine which is the best vegan protein powder for you.</p>
<p>Each primary plant ingredient (pea, rice, hemp) will have its own features and nutritional benefits. Using a vegan protein powder that is a blend of plant-based protein (rice and pea) is an excellent option as they contain a more complete source of protein, meaning your body will gain more rewards both nutritionally and physically. Ensure that your vegan protein powder contains all-natural ingredients and no artificial flavours, additives or preservatives.</p>
<p>At Happy Way, our vegan protein powders are packed full of goodness! Created with the highest quality raw, ancient and organic superfood supplements, they’re filled with natural antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Happy Way loves the organic way because the ingredients are in their truest form, bursting with nutrients that haven’t been covered with chemicals.

<div class="question"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>WHAT’S THE BEST VEGAN PROTEIN FOR MUSCLE REPAIR?</div>

<div style="display: none;" class="answer">
